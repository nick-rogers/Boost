              <h2>GIVE A BOOST, GET A BOOST</h2>
              <p class="in copy">During finals week, there’s nothing college students crave more than coffee and a reminder that they’ve got what it takes to conquer their exams. <em>Give a Boost, Get a Boost</em> is a design project that shares encouragement between stressed college students through the familiar medium of coffee. The project was created by <span><a href="http://nickrogers.design/">Nick</a></span>, <span><a href="https://bersabeh.myportfolio.com/">Bersabeh</a></span>, <span><a href="https://katiebumatay.myportfolio.com/">Katie</a></span>, and <span><a href="https://lkang.myportfolio.com/works">Lianne</a></span> for their conditional and relational design course. </p>

            <h2>OUR CONCEPT</h2>
            <p class="in copy">Witnessing the pressure that finals put on our classmates, we decided to apply relational design principles to the issue. <span><a href="http://sds.parsons.edu/designdialogues/?post_type=article&p=68">Relational design</a></span> focuses on facilitating interactions between participants rather than producing a physical product or visual design. We toyed with several ideas but were most compelled by the idea of creating a popup coffee stand on campus and giving away free coffee with words on encouragement on the cups.<br/><br/>
            Who understands the plight of stressed students better than fellow students? Knowing this, we wanted the messages on the cups to be from previous visitors to our stand. By providing coffee in exchange for written words of encouragement, we could pass inspiration from one student to another. To arrange these interactions, we needed a clear set of steps for us and the user to follow, as well as a method to physically transfer and document their messages. </p>

                <h2>TESTING</h2>
                <p class="in copy">Testing was integral to our project’s success. By iterating on the materials and the interactions we’d designed, we honed our concept to the point of readiness. 
                <br/><br/>
                We quickly found that using customized coffee sleeves was more effective than writing messages directly on cups, as the sleeves gave insulation from the heat of the coffee and allowed us to scan the written messages before we attached them to a cup and gave them to another student.
                <br/><br/>
                We originally allotted time for us to grind coffee beans and for the user to choose a particular message from a pile for their cup. While potentially fun and novel, these steps were not essential to our project’s simple goal of giving encouragement and energy in a speedy fashion. Our users were in a rush; they did not need potentially confusing and unnecessary steps.</p>

            <h2>INTERACTIONS</h2>
            <p class="in copy">We broke the experience down into a short set of steps and delegated roles for the four students in our team. 
            <br/><br/>
            The steps were as follows:</p>

            <ol>
              <li>A student approaches our stand and we get their attention by asking if they’d like some free coffee</li>
              <li>One member explains how all they need to do is to write some encouragement for another student. While this is taking place, our team barista is pouring their coffee</li>
              <li>Once they’ve written their message, we hand them a full cup of coffee with an inspirational message on the sleeve</li>
              <li>As the student happily strolls off to class, we scan their message and stack it for a future student </li>
            </ol>

            <p class="in copy">
            When it came to actual operation our coffee stand, many of these steps altered and our roles became more fluid as we adapted to unexpected challenges, but they proved to be a strong framework for our project. </p>

                <h2>CREATING<br/> THE CAFE</h2>
                <p class="in copy">While we planned on calling out to students and asking them if they wanted free coffee, we needed more ways of getting their attention. This is where the branding and presentation of our coffee stand came in. 
                <br/><br/>
                Playing off of our title, <em>Give a Boost, Get a Boost</em>, we designed a customized banner for our table and matching coffee sleeves. By boldly advertising “FREE COFFEE” on the banner we could cut through the visual clutter around the users and communicate our message to students who couldn’t hear our voices (AirPods were the main issue here).  
                <br/><br/>
                Our project’s branding was simple and lively. Through our bright yellow-and-red scheme and concise title, we aimed to make our project instantly recognizable when spotted on a cup and memorable to those who absorbed the positive message of our sign, even if they didn’t have the time to grab a coffee. </p>

            <h2>SPREADING ENCOURAGEMENT</h2>
            <p class="in copy">On a rainy Tuesday morning in finals week we ground coffee, printed our signs, and set up our stand under an overpass leading to campus. At about 9:00 AM we opened for business.<br/><br/>
            With the help of upbeat music on a bluetooth speaker and our bold sign we quickly began to garner interest. The number of passing students ebbed and flowed at the top of every hour, and while everyone was in a hurry, more and more students took us up on our offer for coffee and encouragement.<br/><br/> 
            We were using a drip coffee filter, and while this added to the “upscale” feel of our stand, it meant we could hardly brew more than 5 or 6 cups at a time. However, by filling cups in advance and hustling to get the sleeves scanned, we met the challenge and served over 36 cups in two hours.<br/><br/>
            We were amazed by the engagement we got from students. We met the users where they were physically and mentally, and gave them a chance to let other students know they’re valued. The caffeine didn’t hurt either. </p>
