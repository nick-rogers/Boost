          <h2>GIVE A BOOST, GET A BOOST</h2>
          <p class="in copy">During finals week, there’s nothing college students need more than invigorating coffee and a reminder that they’ve got what it takes to conquer their exams. Give a Boost, Get a Boost is a design project that shares encouragement between stressed college students through the familiar medium of coffee. The project was created by Nick, Bersabeh, Katie, and Lianne for their conditional and relational design course. </p>

            <h2>OUR CONCEPT</h2>
            <p class="in copy">Witnessing the pressure that finals put on our classmates, we decided to apply relational design principles to the issue. Relational design focuses on facilitating interactions between participants, rather than producing a simple physical product or visual design. We toyed with a bunch of ideas but we were most drawn to the rough idea of creating our own popup coffee stand on campus and giving away free coffee with words on encouragement on the cups.<br/><br/>
            Who knows the plight of stressed students better than their fellow students? Knowing this, we wanted the messages on the cups to be from previous participants at our stand. By creating an exchange of encouragement for coffee, we’d pass personalized inspiration from one student to another. For us to arrange these interactions, we needed a clear set of steps for us and the user to follow, and a method to physically transfer and document their messages. </p>
